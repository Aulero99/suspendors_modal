<h1 align="center">Suspendors Modals</h1>

<p align="left">
    Modal addon module to the Suspendors grid system.
</p>

## suspendors_modals beta 0.0.X

<p>
    The goal of this module is to add full modal support to the suspendors framework so that it remains microscopic in size but robust and consistent in implementation across all platforms and screen sizes. Take note that this module is still in beta and therefore there may still be bugs to work out that the Suspendors team has yet to catch.   
</p>

## Installation
<p>
    <b>NOTE - release of beta 0.0.1 is scheduled for 2/24/24, installation via npm will not be possible until then</b>

First you will need to install Suspendors, for more details click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)

To install `_modal` there are currently 2 options:

- Clone the repo: `https://github.com/Aulero99/suspendors_modal.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install suspendors_modals`
</p>

<p>
After installation you need to import the modal to the root of your project's scss stylesheet:

`@import "suspendors_modal";`

This will give your project access to the scss modal rules.
</p>

<p>
Then you need to import the javascript to the root of your project (see 'Using the Javascript Events' below):

`import { modals } from 'suspendors_modal';`

</p>
